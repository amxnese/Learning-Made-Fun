          <h2>Loops in JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript provides several loop structures to handle repetitive
            tasks. These structures allow you to run the same block of code
            multiple times with different values or conditions. Here's a
            breakdown of the common types of loops used in JavaScript:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>for loop:</strong> Executes a block of code a specified
              number of times, ideal for when the number of iterations is known
              beforehand.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>while loop:</strong> Continues to execute a block of code
              as long as a specified condition remains true.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>do-while loop:</strong> Similar to the while loop, but it
              guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once
              because the condition is checked after the code execution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>for-in loop:</strong> Iterates over the properties of an
              object.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>for-of loop:</strong> Iterates over iterable objects such
              as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more, accessing the value
              of each distinct property.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Use Loops in JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            Loops are an essential part of JavaScript programming, enabling
            developers to execute a block of code multiple times efficiently.
            Here are the primary reasons for using loops in JavaScript:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduce Code Redundancy:</strong> Loops allow you to reduce
              code redundancy and simplify your codebase by eliminating the need
              to manually repeat similar or identical blocks of code multiple
              times.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automate Repetitive Tasks:</strong> Whether it's
              processing elements in an array, handling repetitive user inputs,
              or generating dynamic HTML content, loops automate these tasks
              efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Handle Data Collections:</strong> JavaScript often deals
              with collections of data like arrays or objects. Loops make it
              easy to iterate through these data structures and manipulate each
              element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Control Flow:</strong> Loops provide control over how and
              when certain blocks of code execute based on dynamic conditions,
              which can change during the execution of the script.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improve Performance:</strong> Efficient use of loops can
              lead to performance improvements, especially when dealing with
              large volumes of data or complex operations that need to be
              repeated several times.

          <h2>When to Use Loops in JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            Loops are a powerful tool in JavaScript that should be used in
            various situations to make your code more efficient and readable.
            Here are some common scenarios when it's appropriate to use loops:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Iterating Over Arrays:</strong> Use loops to perform
              actions on each element of an array. This is common in tasks like
              summing numbers, searching for a value, or manipulating data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Working with Objects:</strong> For-in loops are
              particularly useful for iterating over the properties of an
              object, allowing you to access keys and values dynamically.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repeating Actions:</strong> If you need to repeat a
              certain task a set number of times, such as creating multiple DOM
              elements based on user input, loops are the ideal choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Processing Data Until a Condition is Met:</strong> While
              and do-while loops are useful when you need to continue a process
              until a particular condition changes, such as waiting for a user
              to provide valid input.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Handling Asynchronous Processes:</strong> Loops can be
              used in conjunction with asynchronous processes, such as fetching
              multiple URLs in sequence or in parallel, where you loop through
              an array of URLs to make fetch calls.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>JavaScript Loop Examples</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript provides a variety of loops for different scenarios. Here
            are examples of each type of loop to demonstrate how they are used
            in JavaScript programming:
          </p>

          <h3>Example 1: for loop</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              // Looping through an array using for loop
              const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
              for (let i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
                  console.log(numbers[i]);
              }
            </code>
          </pre>

          <h3>Example 2: while loop</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              // Looping until a condition is met using while loop
              let count = 0;
              while (count &lt; 5) {
                  console.log('Count:', count);
                  count++;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h3>Example 3: do-while loop</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              // Executing code at least once with do-while loop
              let result;
              do {
                  result = prompt("Enter a number greater than 10", "");
              } while (result &lt;= 10);
            </code>
          </pre>

          <h3>Example 4: for-in loop</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              // Iterating over object properties using for-in loop
              const person = {fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25};
              for (let key in person) {
                  console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
              }
            </code>
          </pre>

          <h3>Example 5: for-of loop</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              // Iterating over an array using for-of loop
              const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
              for (let color of colors) {
                  console.log(color);
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            These examples illustrate how each type of loop can be used in
            JavaScript to handle a variety of programming tasks, from processing
            items in arrays and objects to ensuring conditions are met before
            proceeding.
