          <h2>What are built-in functions</h2>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, a built-in function typically refers to the methods
            provided by Java's standard libraries, which are part of the Java
            API. These methods are readily available for use without the need
            for the programmer to define them. They serve a wide range of
            purposes, from mathematical calculations to handling strings, files,
            and data collections.

          <h2>Why we use built-in functions</h2>
          <p>
            We use built-in functions in programming languages like Java for
            several important reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Built-in functions are often
              optimized for performance by the language developers. They are
              implemented in a way that maximizes speed and minimizes resource
              usage, which can be hard to achieve with custom code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reliability:</strong> These functions have been thoroughly
              tested and are used widely, ensuring that they are reliable and
              free from common bugs. This reduces the risk of errors in your own
              code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simplicity:</strong> Built-in functions simplify the
              coding process by providing ready-to-use solutions for routine
              tasks, allowing developers to accomplish more with less code. This
              makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Portability:</strong> Using built-in functions ensures
              that your code can run on any platform that supports the Java
              runtime, without needing any modifications. This is because the
              functionality of these functions is defined as part of the Java
              standard.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Productivity:</strong> By reducing the need to write and
              test custom implementations of common functionalities, built-in
              functions allow developers to focus more on the specific logic and
              features unique to their applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standardization:</strong> Built-in functions promote
              coding standards and best practices. When developers use these
              functions, it helps maintain a uniformity in coding styles across
              different projects, which is beneficial for code maintenance and
              team collaboration.
