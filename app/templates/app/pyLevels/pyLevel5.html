          <h2>What are Loops</h2>
          <p>
            Loops are a fundamental programming concept that allows a block of
            code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition.
          </p>
          Python has two primitive loop commands:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="keyword">while</span> loops</li>
            <li><span class="keyword">for</span> loops</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>for loop:</h4>
          <p>
            A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a
            list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like
            the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like
            an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming
            languages. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements,
            once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. It is used when the
            number of iterations is known.
          </p>
          <h4>while loop:</h4>
          <p>
            Repeats as long as a certain boolean condition is met. It is used
            when the number of iterations is not known before the loop starts.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Use Loops in Programming?</h2>
          <p>
            Loops are a fundamental component of programming that allow us to
            perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Below are some of the primary
            reasons we use loops:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Automation:</strong> Loops automate repetitive tasks,
              reducing the need to write the same code multiple times.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Using loops, we can traverse through
              data structures like lists, arrays, or strings, and manipulate
              large amounts of data with minimal code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Control:</strong> Loops give programmers control over how
              many times certain operations are executed, based on dynamic
              conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simplicity:</strong> Loops simplify complex problems into
              manageable tasks by breaking them down into repeated subtasks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When to Use Loops in Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding when to utilize loops in your code is crucial for
            writing efficient and readable programs. Here are some common
            scenarios where loops are particularly useful:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Processing Collections:</strong> Use loops to iterate
              through elements in a collection such as a list, tuple, or
              dictionary to perform operations on each element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repeating Actions:</strong> When you need to repeat a
              specific action multiple times, loops make your code more compact
              and maintainable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conditional Execution:</strong> Loops can run a block of
              code until a certain condition changes (like receiving a specific
              user input).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generating Sequences:</strong> Loops are ideal for
              generating sequences of numbers, processing series, or creating
              repeated patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automating Tasks:</strong> Any task that requires
              automation, such as sending emails to a list of users, can be
              efficiently managed with loops.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Keywords Related to Loops in Python</h2>
          <p>
            In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly
            under certain conditions. Here are some key terms and keywords
            associated with looping in Python:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="keyword">for</span> - Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list,
              tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="keyword">while</span> - Repeats a block of code as long as a

          <h2>Python Loop Examples</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding loops in Python can be greatly enhanced with practical
            examples. Here are some common examples of using both
            <span class="keyword">for</span> and <span class="keyword">while</span> loops in Python:
          </p>
          <h3>Example 1: Using a for loop to iterate over a list</h3>
          <pre><code><span class="white">fruits</span> <span class="pink">=</span> <span class="orange">[</span><span class="yellow">"apple"</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="yellow">"banana"</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="yellow">"cherry"</span><span class="orange">]</span>
<span class="pink">for</span> <span class="white">fruit</span> <span class="pink">in</span> <span class="white">fruits</span><span class="orange">:</span>
  <span class="blue">print</span><span class="orange">(</span><span class="yellow">"I like"</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="white">fruit</span><span class="orange">)</span>
<span class="comment"># output:</span>
<span class="comment">'''
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
'''</span></code></pre>
          <h3>
            Example 2: Using a while loop to execute until a condition is met
          </h3>
          <pre><code><span class="white">count</span> <span class="pink">=</span> <span class="purple">1</span>
<span class="pink">while</span> <span class="white">count</span> <span class="pink">&lt;=</span> <span class="purple">5</span><span class="orange">:</span>
  <span class="blue">print</span><span class="orange">(</span><span class="yellow">"Count is:"</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="white">count</span><span class="orange">)</span>
  <span class="white">count</span> <span class="pink">+=</span> <span class="purple">1</span></code></pre>
          
          <p>
            this loop will stay on until <strong>count</strong> is greater than
            or equal to five
          </p>

          <h3>Example 3: Using a for loop with the range function</h3>
          <pre><code><span class="pink">for</span> <span class="white">number</span> <span class="pink">in</span> <span class="blue">range</span><span class="orange">(</span><span class="purple">1</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="purple">11</span><span class="orange">):</span>
  <span class="blue">print</span><span class="orange">(</span><span class="yellow">"Number is"</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="white">number</span><span class="orange">)</span></code></pre>
          
          <p>
            this loop will iterate on the <span class="keyword">print</span> function 10 times
            and will print numbers from 1 to 10. Note that the first initial
            value is included white the final value is excluded
          </p>

          <h3>Example 4: Nested loops to create a pattern</h3>
          <pre><code><span class="pink">for</span> <span class="white">i</span> <span class="pink">in</span> <span class="blue">range</span><span class="orange">(</span><span class="purple">1</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="purple">4</span><span class="orange">):</span>  <span class="comment"># Outer loop</span>
  <span class="pink">for</span> <span class="white">j</span> <span class="pink">in</span> <span class="blue">range</span><span class="orange">(</span><span class="purple">1</span><span class="white">,</span> <span class="purple">4</span><span class="orange">):</span>  <span class="comment"># Inner loop</span>
    <span class="blue">print</span><span class="orange">(</span><span class="blue">f</span><span class="yellow">"i = {i}, j = {j}"</span><span class="orange">)</span></code></pre>
          
          <p>
            These examples showcase different ways to use loops in Python, from
            iterating through collections to using nested loops for complex
            patterns.
