          <h2>What are Loops</h2>
          <p>
            Loops are a fundamental programming concept that allows a block of
            code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition.
          </p>
          <ul>
            Python has two primitive loop commands:
            <li><code>while</code> loops</li>
            <li><code>for</code> loops</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>for loop:</h4>
          <p>
            A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a
            list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like
            the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like
            an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming
            languages. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements,
            once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. It is used when the
            number of iterations is known.
          </p>
          <h4>while loop:</h4>
          <p>
            Repeats as long as a certain boolean condition is met. It is used
            when the number of iterations is not known before the loop starts.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Use Loops in Programming?</h2>
          <p>
            Loops are a fundamental component of programming that allow us to
            perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Below are some of the primary
            reasons we use loops:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Automation:</strong> Loops automate repetitive tasks,
              reducing the need to write the same code multiple times.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Using loops, we can traverse through
              data structures like lists, arrays, or strings, and manipulate
              large amounts of data with minimal code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Control:</strong> Loops give programmers control over how
              many times certain operations are executed, based on dynamic
              conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simplicity:</strong> Loops simplify complex problems into
              manageable tasks by breaking them down into repeated subtasks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When to Use Loops in Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding when to utilize loops in your code is crucial for
            writing efficient and readable programs. Here are some common
            scenarios where loops are particularly useful:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Processing Collections:</strong> Use loops to iterate
              through elements in a collection such as a list, tuple, or
              dictionary to perform operations on each element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repeating Actions:</strong> When you need to repeat a
              specific action multiple times, loops make your code more compact
              and maintainable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conditional Execution:</strong> Loops can run a block of
              code until a certain condition changes (like receiving a specific
              user input).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generating Sequences:</strong> Loops are ideal for
              generating sequences of numbers, processing series, or creating
              repeated patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automating Tasks:</strong> Any task that requires
              automation, such as sending emails to a list of users, can be
              efficiently managed with loops.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Keywords Related to Loops in Python</h2>
          <p>
            In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly
            under certain conditions. Here are some key terms and keywords
            associated with looping in Python:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>for</code> - Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list,
              tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>while</code> - Repeats a block of code as long as a
              condition is true.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>break</code> - Exits the loop immediately, regardless of the
              iteration condition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>continue</code> - Skips the current iteration of the loop
              and moves to the next iteration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>else</code> - Optionally used after a loop to execute a
              block of code once when the loop condition is no longer true.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>range()</code> - Often used with for loops to generate a
              sequence of numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>enumerate()</code> - Used to loop through a sequence but it
              keeps track of both the index and the value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>iter()</code> - Used to create an iterator object, and can
              be used with a loop to iterate through the elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>next()</code> - Used to get the next item from an iterator.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Python Loop Examples</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding loops in Python can be greatly enhanced with practical
            examples. Here are some common examples of using both
            <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops in Python:
          </p>
          <h3>Example 1: Using a for loop to iterate over a list</h3>
          <pre>
          <code>
            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            for fruit in fruits:
              print("I like", fruit)
            # output:
            '''
            I like apple
            I like banana
            I like cherry
            '''
          </code>
          </pre>
          <h3>
            Example 2: Using a while loop to execute until a condition is met
          </h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
            count = 1
            while count &lt;= 5:
              print("Count is:", count)
              count += 1
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            this loop will stay on until <strong>count</strong> is greater than
            or equal to five
          </p>

          <h3>Example 3: Using a for loop with the range function</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              for number in range(1, 11):
                print("Number is", number)
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            this loop will iterate on the <code>print</code> function 10 times
            and will print numbers from 1 to 10. Note that the first initial
            value is included white the final value is excluded
          </p>

          <h3>Example 4: Nested loops to create a pattern</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop
                for j in range(1, 4):  # Inner loop
                  print(f"i = {i}, j = {j}")
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            These examples showcase different ways to use loops in Python, from
            iterating through collections to using nested loops for complex
            patterns.
