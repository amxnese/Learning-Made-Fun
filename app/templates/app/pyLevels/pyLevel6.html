          <h2>Functions in Python</h2>
          <p>
            Functions in Python are named blocks of code designed to do one
            specific job. They allow you to write reusable pieces of code that
            can be executed multiple times throughout your program. Functions
            can take in parameters, which are additional pieces of data that
            customize the function for a particular need, and return a result.
          </p>

          <h3>Benefits of Using Functions:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Reusability:</strong> Write the code once and use it
              multiple times throughout your program.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Modularity:</strong> Break down complex processes into
              smaller, manageable pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scalability:</strong> Make a program easier to expand and
              maintain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Debugging:</strong> Easier to isolate and fix bugs in
              smaller blocks of code.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How to Define a Function</h3>
          <p>Here is how you can define a simple function in Python:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              def greet_user(username):
                <span class="comment">#Display a simple greeting message.</span>
                print(f"Hello, {username}!")
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h3>Calling a Function</h3>
          <p>
            Once a function is defined, you can 'call' it by using its name
            followed by parentheses (including any necessary arguments). Here's
            how you can call the <code>greet_user</code> function:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              greet_user('Alice')
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p>
            This function call results in the output: <em>Hello, Alice!</em>
          </p>

          <h2>Keywords Related to Functions in Python</h2>
          <p>
            Here are some important keywords in Python that are related to
            functions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>def:</strong> Used to define a new function.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>return:</strong> Exits the function and returns a value to
              the caller.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>lambda:</strong> Used to create small anonymous functions
              composed of a single expression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>global:</strong> Used inside a function to refer to a
              variable defined in the global scope.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>nonlocal:</strong> Used to refer to variables defined in
              the nearest enclosing scope that is not global.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>yield:</strong> Used to turn a function into a generator.
              This keyword returns a value and pauses the function's execution,
              resuming from there the next time the function is called.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>async:</strong> Declares an asynchronous function, which
              allows it to perform asynchronous operations using
              <code>await</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Use Functions in Python?</h2>
          <p>
            Functions are a fundamental aspect of Python programming, serving
            several critical purposes that enhance the efficiency and
            readability of code. Here's why functions are essential:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Modularity:</strong> Functions allow you to break down
              complex processes into smaller, manageable parts. This helps in
              isolating functionality, which makes the program easier to
              understand and maintain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reusability:</strong> Once a function is written, it can
              be used repeatedly throughout a program. This avoids duplication
              of code, reduces errors, and saves time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scoping:</strong> Functions help in defining a variable's
              scope, which means that variables declared inside a function are
              not accessible from outside the function. This helps in preventing
              variables from interfering with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Abstraction:</strong> By using functions, you can abstract
              away the details of complex operations. Users of your functions do
              not need to understand the inner workings of those functions to
              benefit from them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Functions make the code more
              organized and manageable. When a change needs to be made, you can
              usually make it in one place rather than in many different places.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Testing:</strong> Functions can be individually tested,
              which makes debugging easier. This compartmentalization helps in
              identifying and fixing bugs more efficiently.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Here's an example of defining and calling a simple function in
            Python:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              def calculate_area(width, height):
                  <span class="comment">#Calculate the area of a rectangle.</span>
                  return width * height

              <span class="commment"># Call the function with width=5 and height=10</span>
              area = calculate_area(5, 10)
              print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p>
            This function, <code>calculate_area</code>, calculates the area of a
            rectangle, demonstrating the practical use of functions to perform
            specific tasks.

          <h2>When to Use Functions in Python</h2>
          <p>
            Functions in Python are used to encapsulate code that performs a
            specific task into a single unit that can be used repeatedly. Here
            are some scenarios when you might want to use functions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Code Reusability:</strong> When you have code that you
              need to use multiple times in your program, you can define it once
              in a function and call that function whenever you need to perform
              that task.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Organizing Code:</strong> Functions can help to break down
              a large program into smaller, manageable, and organized segments.
              Each function can be responsible for a specific functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Modularity:</strong> Using functions allows you to write
              more modular code. This means you can develop independent
              functions that are not dependent on the inner details of other
              functions, making it easier to update and maintain your code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Parameterization:</strong> Functions allow you to
              parameterize your code, making it more general and flexible. You
              can pass parameters (inputs) to a function to produce different
              outputs based on those inputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Debugging:</strong> Debugging becomes easier when using
              functions, as you can isolate parts of your program and check them
              independently for errors.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Examples of Using Functions in Python</h2>
          <p>
            Functions in Python are defined using the <code>def</code> keyword
            followed by the function name and parentheses. Here are some
            practical examples to illustrate their use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Function:</strong>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  def greet(name):
                    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
                  greet('Alice')
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                This function takes a name as a parameter and prints a greeting
                message.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Function with Return Value:</strong>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  def add(a, b):
                    return a + b
                  result = add(5, 3)
                  print(result)
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>This function adds two numbers and returns the result.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Function with Default Parameters:</strong>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  def info(article, price=50):
                    print(f"Article: {article}, Price: {price}")
                  info('Notebook')
                  info('Pen', 10)
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                This function has a default parameter for price. If no price is
                provided, it defaults to 50.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Function with Variable-length Arguments:</strong>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  def print_scores(student, *scores):
                    print(f"Scores for {student}:")
                    for score in scores:
                      print(score)
                  print_scores('John', 92, 85, 88)
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                This function accepts a variable number of scores and prints
                each one of them. Useful for situations where the number of
                arguments is not known in advance.
              </p>

          <h2>Recursion in Python</h2>
          <p>
            Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself
            in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's
            commonly used in Python to handle problems that can be broken down
            into simpler, repetitive tasks. Here are some key points and an
            example to illustrate recursion in Python:
          </p>

          <p>Recursion involves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Base Case:</strong> The condition under which the
              recursion stops. This prevents the function from calling itself
              infinitely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recursive Case:</strong> The part of the function that
              calls itself to continue the recursion.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Example: Calculating Factorials Using Recursion</h3>
          <p>
            The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all
            positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              def factorial(n):
                <span class="comment"># Base case: if n is 0 or 1</span>
                if n in (0, 1):
                  return 1
                <span class="comment"># Recursive case: n times the factorial of n-1</span>
                else:
                  return n * factorial(n - 1)
            
                <span class="comment"># Example usage</span>
                print(factorial(5))  <span class="comment"># Outputs: 120</span>
            </code>
          </pre>

          <h3>Example: Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion</h3>
          <p>
            The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number
            is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The sequence
            commonly starts with 0 and 1.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              def fibonacci(n):
                <span class="comment"># Base cases: if n is 0 or 1</span>
                if n in (0, 1):
                  return n
                <span class="comment"># Recursive case: sum of the two preceding numbers</span>
                else:
                  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
            
              <span class="comment"># Example usage</span>
              print(fibonacci(6))  <span class="comment"># Outputs: 8</span>
