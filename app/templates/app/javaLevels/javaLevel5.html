          <h2>What are Loops</h2>
          <p>
            Loops in programming are constructs that repeat a block of code
            multiple times based on a specified condition or until a certain
            condition is met. They are fundamental for tasks that require
            repetitive actions, such as iterating over arrays, processing data
            repeatedly, or simply waiting for a condition to change.
          </p>

          <h2>Loops in Java</h2>
          <p>
            Java supports several types of loops to handle looping requirements,
            including for, while, and do-while loops. Each serves a different
            purpose and is used under different circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>for loop:</strong> Best used when the number of iterations
              is known before the loop starts. It's often used for iterating
              over arrays and collections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>while loop:</strong> Ideal when the number of iterations
              is not known and the loop needs to continue until a particular
              condition is met.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>do-while loop:</strong> Similar to the while loop, but
              guarantees at least one iteration, as the condition is checked
              after the loop's body.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Use Loops in Java?</h2>
          <p>
            Loops are essential in Java for various reasons, enabling
            programmers to manage code that needs repetition efficiently. Here's
            why loops are commonly used:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Code Efficiency:</strong> Loops reduce the need to write
              and manage duplicate code, making programs shorter and easier to
              understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Handling Data:</strong> They allow developers to easily
              iterate through data structures like arrays, lists, or sets to
              perform operations on each element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Condition-based Execution:</strong> Loops make it possible
              to run a block of code multiple times under specific conditions,
              enhancing the dynamic capabilities of applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resource Management:</strong> Using loops, resources like
              network connections or file operations can be managed effectively
              in scenarios such as retrying failed operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automation of Repetitive Tasks:</strong> Any repetitive
              task, whether it's processing user inputs, generating output based
              on varying data, or periodic checks within an application, can be
              automated using loops.

          <h2>When to Use Loops in Java</h2>
          <p>
            Knowing when to implement loops in Java is crucial for writing
            effective and efficient code. Here are several scenarios where using
            loops is particularly useful:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Processing Items in a Collection:</strong> Use loops to
              iterate through collections such as arrays, ArrayLists, or
              HashMaps to process each item.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repeating Tasks:</strong> When you need to repeat certain
              tasks until a condition is met (e.g., user input validation).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generating Repeated Outputs:</strong> Loops are ideal for
              generating repeated outputs, such as patterns or series of
              numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automating Repetitive Actions:</strong> Any task that
              requires repetitive actions, such as updating database entries or
              sending emails to a list of users, can be automated using loops.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conditional Operations:</strong> When performing
              operations that require decisions based on dynamic data
              conditions, loops can be used to continue processing until the
              desired state is reached.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Keywords Related to Loops in Java</h2>
          <p>
            Java offers several loop structures for iterative operations. Here
            are some of the keywords and concepts associated with looping in
            Java:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>for</code> - A loop that is used to iterate a set number of
              times, typically using a counter. Includes traditional
              <code>for</code> loops and enhanced <code>for-each</code> loops.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>while</code> - Executes a block of statements repeatedly as
              long as the given condition remains true.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>do-while</code> - Similar to the <code>while</code> loop,
              but it ensures that the loop is executed at least once before the
              condition is tested.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>break</code> - Immediately exits the loop, skipping any
              remaining iterations and moving control out of the loop.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>continue</code> - Skips the current iteration and proceeds
              to the next iteration of the loop.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>label</code> - Used with <code>break</code> or
              <code>continue</code> to alter the flow in nested loops.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Iterator</code> - An interface used to iterate over
              collections, commonly used in conjunction with loops to traverse
              through elements.
            </li>
          </ul>
